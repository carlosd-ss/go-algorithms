//- Using the solution from the previous exercise:
//1. In package-level scope, using the var keyword, create a variable with the identifier "y". The type of this variable must be the underlying type of the type you created in the previous exercise.
//2. In the main function:
//1. This should already be done:
//1. Demonstrate the value of the variable "x"
//2. Demonstrate the type of the variable "x"
//3. Assign 42 to the variable "x" using the operator "="
//4. Demonstrate the value of the variable "x"
//2. Now also do:
//1. Use conversion to transform the value type of the variable "x" into its underlying type and, using the "=" operator, assign the value from "x" to "y"
//2. Demonstrate the value of "y"
//3. Demonstrate the "y" type

package main

import "fmt"

type Go int

var x Go
var y int

func main() {
	fmt.Printf("%v\n%T\n", x, x)
	x = 42
	fmt.Println(x)

	y = int(x)

	fmt.Printf("%v\n%T\n", y, y)

}
